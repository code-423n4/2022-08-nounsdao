I've noticed `NounsDAOProxy.sol` is in scope, but is there any reason  `NounsDAOProxyV2.sol` is not?

did you run it with `--ffi`?

yep


[08/22/2022 9:01 PM] el4d
we added ProxyV2 for forkers of the protocol, it's never used in production, since we will upgrade DAO v1 to v2 using the already-deployed original proxy

assuming you have the latest foundry properly installed it should work fine I think

[08/22/2022 9:06 PM] solimander
ah, must be because `readFile` uses `cat`

Thanks man and quick question who is going to be the admin of noundaologicv2 ?


[08/22/2022 9:26 PM] el4d
that remains the same as it is today, since `admin` is stored on the proxy, and that would be the Executor contract

what is the difference between "NounsAuctionHouse" contract and "NounsAuctionHouseProxy" contract


[08/23/2022 11:29 AM] davidbrai
NounsAuctionHouseProxy is a proxy contract and NounsAuctionHouse is logic contract that the proxy point to.
it's to enable future upgrades of the logic contract

NounsDAOLogicV1.sol is in scope, but V2 is gonna replace it.
Should we include QA/Gas optimization findings of NounsDAOLogicV1.sol?
Or should we analyze it just for means of safe migration?


[08/23/2022 12:16 PM] heuss
Since they wont use it anymore probably useless to report finding that only impact the v1


[08/23/2022 12:18 PM] el4d
Focus on v2 is best


[08/23/2022 12:18 PM] el4d
Thank you!


[08/23/2022 12:24 PM] JohnSmith#1623
So are all findings for NounsDAOLogicV1.sol that don't impact migration will be invalidated?
I just don't want the situation where some did report because it is in scope, others did not, because it is not gonna be used. Everyone should be on the same page.


[08/23/2022 12:40 PM] pfapostol
v2 is an updated version of v1, so probably 99% of the gas/quality assurance issues of v1 are common to v2.


[08/23/2022 12:45 PM] JohnSmith#1623
I prefer yes/no,  not probably


[08/23/2022 1:12 PM] dravee
V1 is in scope so it will be rewarded (I helped with scouting the contest). Sponsor did say to focus on V2 but as the scope was already agreed on, your findings on V1 won't get invalidated.
Also you get to look at things that could break during the update like storage etc. 🙂

If you find something out of scope, you can always contact the team behind the contract to let them know; but don't actively search for them

"function doSomething() public {
        require(msg.sender == address(this));"

I saw this pattern in the Nouns DAO code. Is there any significant reason to do this rather than make the function private?


[08/24/2022 5:36 AM] tabish.eth
i think the call to those functions is by a transaction therefore they are required to be public


[08/24/2022 5:53 AM] joevl

I sometimes marvel out how incredibly hackable the entire Ethereum smart contract space would be if we could just do hash collisions. You could pretty much modify any storage location just by using a public `mapping` variable and passing in the right values. Thank god for Second Pre-image Resistance.


[08/26/2022 6:30 AM] 0xpathfindr
Question. If there is an internal function that sends ETH to an arbitrary user. Will its severity be reduced because the function is internal rather than external ?


[08/26/2022 6:31 AM] 0xpathfindr
And isn't it good practice for every transfer function to check if a user (e.g msg,sender ) is the intended user to send/ receive funds to/from ?

Hi, can i check why this issue I made https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao-findings/issues/211 was moved to QA even though it appeared as a vulnerability in M-03 in the final report?  @davidbrai @gzeon

[10/01/2022 11:21 AM] R2#8087
Hi guys! 

I have a question about Nouns DAO contest

There is a M-3 finding: https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao-findings/issues/315

I'm also found it, but sent it to "QA report" and it wasn't accepted

Is it correct? Or I can to appeal it?


[10/01/2022 11:28 AM] illilli000
once awards are announced it's too late


[10/01/2022 11:29 AM] R2#8087
But how could i see the results before?


[10/01/2022 11:32 AM] R2#8087
Can you please explain if it's possible to see the results before awards announcement?


[10/01/2022 11:33 AM] R2#8087
And to be able to appeal results


[10/01/2022 11:38 AM] codingnamekiki
only the backstage people can defend their issues, when the project is in judging phase. Am l right @IllIllI

👍 

[10/01/2022 11:39 AM] R2#8087
So I had no ability to see result before and to appeal it? 
So can I do it now, when I know results?


[10/01/2022 11:40 AM] codingnamekiki
Like he said, after the awards are announced, you can’t do anything


[10/01/2022 11:41 AM] R2#8087
So it's never possible to appeal results? Because I see results only after awards are announced


[10/01/2022 11:44 AM] illilli000

Well, let me also apply for the backstage role then.


[10/02/2022 7:04 PM] d3e4
R2’s report is somewhat different, but considering others' were approved for simply suggesting a zero-address check (rather than two-step), yours should perhaps be considered a duplicate as well. I fear they simply missed it, as you submitted it as a QA.

yixxas’ report, however, is spot on compared to the accepted issue, but was submitted as a high-risk.

This must suck, as the payout was quite high.

My gas- and QA-reports also seem to have been graded strangely low as well in this contest, compared to some others ranking around mine that I looked at.

Is this something that can be resolved in the judging process? It seems at least that missing duplicates should be something that everyone should be able to dispute before the results are locked. Duplicates are easily assessed but easily missed by the judge.
